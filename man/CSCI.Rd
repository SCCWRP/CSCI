\title{Score samples using the CSCI tool}
\usage{
CSCI(bugs, stations, rand = sample.int(10000, 1), purge = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bugs}{A data frame with BMI data (see details)}

\item{stations}{A data frame with environmental data, one row per station (see details)}

\item{rand}{An integer to control the random number generator (RNG) seed for the subsampling. By default set to
\code{sample.int(10000, 1)}}

\item{purge}{A logical value indicating whether FinalID/LifeStageCode combinations not in the internal
database should be removed from the data. If TRUE, purged taxa will be listed in output. If FALSE (default),
any unrecognized combinations will cause an error.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames that serve as reports in varying detail:
\item{core}{A summary of the CSCI results, and data quality flags, averaged across 20 iterations.}
\item{Suppl1_mmi}{A detailed breakdown of the results of the MMI component of the
 CSCI, averaged across 20 iterations.}
\item{Suppl1_grps}{Probability of biotic group membership in a SampleID by Group format}
\item{Suppl1_OE}{A detailed breakdown of the results of the O/E component of the CSCI,
 averaged across 20 iterations. Capture probabilities and mean abundances of each OTU are provided.}
\item{Suppl2_mmi}{Similar to Suppl1_mmi, except broken down by iteration}
\item{Suppl2_OE}{Similar to Suppl1_OE, except brown down by replicatesiteration. Iteration-wise O/E scores are also provided.}

\description{
A function that aggregates many of the steps involved in the scoring of the California Stream Condition Index
(CSCI) into a single function. These steps include data quality flagging, conversions of taxonomic names,
iterative subsampling (20 iterations), metric calculations, prediction of expected taxa and metric values,
scoring, and aggregation into a final index. Input data includes sample-wise raw, unprocessed taxonomy
in a flat format, and station-wise predictor data in a crosstab format. See example data (\code{\link{bugs_stations}})
for reference. A complete description of the index is provided in Mazor et al. (in review). The O/E component
of this function is adapted from John van Sickle's RIVPACS model building scripts.

\details{
A valid "bugs" data frame consists of the following columns: StationCode, SampleID, FinalID (i.e., taxa names),
LifeStageCode ("A", "L", "P", or "X"), BAResult (i.e., taxa counts), and Distinct (a positive integer where
the taxonomist has indicated distinctiveness, else left blank or 0). Values for FinalID and LifeStageCode
must conform to values from SWAMP lookup tables (\url{http://swamp.mpsl.mlml.calstate.edu/}). See CSCI guidance
document for details on these fields.

A valid "stations" data frame consists of the following columns: StationCode (must match with same column in
the "bugs" data frame), BDH_AVE, ELEV_RANGE, KFCT_AVE, P_MEAN, LogWSA, New_Lat, New_Long, PPT_00_09,
SITE_ELEV, SumAve_P, TEMP_00_09. See CSCI guidance document for details on these fields.

The data frames are also subject to the following constraints: no missing blank cells in any field in
either data frame (except for the Distinct column); all values under StationCode in the "bugs" data frame
must be represented under StationCode in the "stations" data frame; every SampleID must be associated
with only a single StationCode; no duplicated data in either data frame (e.g., every combination of
the SampleID, FinalID, LifeStageCode, and Distinct should be unique in the "bugs" data frame).

In order to produce replicable results, the RNG seed can be controlled using the rand argument. Any integer may be
entered, which will be passed to \code{\link{set.seed}}.
