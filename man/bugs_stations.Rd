\title{Example Data for the CSCI tool}
\description{
A list of two data frames, corresponding to the "bugs" type data frame (benthic macroinvertebrate
 count data) and "stations" type data frame (GIS-based site data) for the CSCI function. This is a toy data set
 and should not be used to make any inferences about the health of the included sites.

The bugs data frame contains the following:
\itemize{
\item StationCode: A code for the location of the sample
\item SampleID: A unique ID for the sample
\item FinalID: Names for the taxa identified in each sample. The names must correspond to a SWAMP FinalID
(see \url{http://swamp.mpsl.mlml.calstate.edu/}).
\item BAResult: A count for that FinalID in that SampleID. Must be a non-negative integer.
\item LifeStageCode: Code for the life stage of the taxon. May be "A", "L", or "P" for insects; all non-insects
must be "X".
\item Distinct: Taxonomist's distinctiveness designation. This will override the automatic distinctiveness
designations made by the CSCI function. 1 indicates distinctiveness, 0 or NA will defer to the function's
designation.
}
The stations data frame contains the following:
\itemize{
\item StationCode: A code for the location of the sample. Every StationCode in the bugs data frame is
also represented here.
\item AREA_SQKM: The area of the watershed in square kilometers
\item New_Long: The site's longitude
\item New_Lat: The site's latitude
\item SITE_ELEV: Elevation in ???
\item TEMP_00_09: The average temperature from 2000 to 2009 in hundredths of degrees C
\item PPT_00_09: The average precipatation from 2000 to 2009 in hundredths of millimeters
\item SumAve_P: ???
\item KFCT_AVE: ???
\item BDH_AVE: ???
\item MgO_Mean: Average soil magnesium oxide in ???
\item P_MEAN: ???
\item CaO_Mean: Average calcareous soils in ???
\item PRMH_AVE: ???
\item S_Mean: ???
\item PCT_SEDIM: Percent sedimentary geology
\item LRPREM_mean: ???
\item N_MEAN: ???
\item LogWSA: \code{log10} of the AREA_SQKM. Not needed if AREA_SQKM is present.
